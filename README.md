# Camerun
A modified version of the camera interface that was published on Element 14's GitHub. This version is aimed at emulating my approach to using my other cameras, helping me achieve a more appropriate aesthetic for what I want to do in a way that's closer to my preferred style, rather than relying on the automatic settings to get it "wrong".

#Testing Suite
This is a small set of tools that I've developed for my own purposes, and I'm sharing them for your use. I'm licensing them under the GPL, which you can find here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

These should run on any raspberry pi. Probably.
